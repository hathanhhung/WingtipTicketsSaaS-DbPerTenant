# Wingtip Tickets SaaS - Database per Tenant (with aliases) 
Sample multi-tenant SaaS application and associated management scripts.  
Built on SQL Database using a database-per-tenant model. 

## Overview
This project provides a sample SaaS application 'WingtipTicketsSaaS' that embodies many common SaaS patterns that can be used with Azure SQL Database. The Wingtip Tickets SaaS sample is based on an event-management and ticket-selling scenario for small venues. Each venue is a 'tenant' of the SaaS application. In this variation of the SaaS application, a DNS alias is created for each tenant. This ensures that no app change is required during a disaster recovery event.

## Differences from main 'Database per Tenant' project
* Deploys the WingtipTicketsSaaS application with tenant aliases that are used to ensure no app change is required during disaster recovery
* Includes script that modifies existing 'dbpertenant' deployment to include aliases for tenants and the catalog database (*Initialize-WingtipSaaSAliases.ps1*)
* Includes catalog functions that operate using tenant alias in order to be agnostic to which region a Wingtip deployment is currently running in

## How to deploy sample app
>**NOTE:** if you install the application, you will be charged for the Azure resources created.  Actual costs incurred are based on your subscription offer type but are nominal if the application is not scaled up unreasonably and is deleted promptly after you have finished exploring the tutorials.

To deploy the app to Azure, click the blue link below. Deploy the app in a new resource group, and provide a short *user* value that will be appended to several resource names to make them globally unique.  Your initials and a number is a good pattern to use.

</a>

The basic application, which includes three pre-defined databases for three venues, can be installed in your Azure subscription under a single ARM resource group. After deployment completes, launch the app by browsing to ```http://events.wingtip-dpt.USER.trafficmanager.net```, substituting *USER* with the value you set during deployment. To uninstall the application, delete the resource group from the Azure Portal.


## How to run management scripts and tutorials
>**IMPORTANT:** If you download and extract the repo or Learning Modules from a zip file, make sure you unblock the .zip file before extracting. Executable contents (scripts, dlls) may be blocked by Windows when zip files are downloaded from an external source and extracted.

>To avoid scripts from being blocked by Windows:

>1. Right click the zip file and select **Properties**.
>2. On the **General** tab, select **Unblock** and select **OK**.

1. Install [AzurePowerShell module 5.0 or above](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/releases). This version of AzurePowerShell adds alias functions for Azure SQL database that will be used in the management scripts.  
*If your PowerShell session does not allow running scripts, make sure you've run the `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` command*

2. Install the SqlServer PowerShell module. This installs cmdline functions like 'Invoke-SqlCmd' that are used by the PowerShell scripts to connect to tenant databases. `Install-Module sqlserver`

3. Clone the repo to your local machine. Or Download and extract the repo to your local machine from a zip file.

4. Run the demo scripts present in the 'Learning Modules' folder.

5. Open the 'GeoRestoreTutorial' document in the Github repo to start the tutorial for disaster recovery using the Azure SQL database geo-restore capability

## Architecture
![Wingtip Architectures](TutorialMedia/AppVersions.PNG)
The sample uses a database-per-tenant model, with a database created for each venue.  
These databases are hosted in elastic database pools to provide easy performance management, and to cost-effectively accommodate the unpredictable usage patterns of these small venues and their customers.  
An additional catalog database holds the mapping between tenants and their databases.  This mapping is managed using the Shard Map Management features of the Elastic Database Client Library.
